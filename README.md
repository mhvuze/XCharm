# XCharm
Simple C# tool for creating a charm.csv from MHX savedata (for use with masax GANSIMU Skill Simulator).

Use as follows:
```
XCharm savedata slotnumber
```

i.e. XCharm system 1 will dump a CHARM.csv from your first character slot. Put CHARM.csv to the /save/ folder of GANSIMU.

Thanks to svanheulen for his [research](https://github.com/svanheulen/mhff/wiki/MHX-system-Format) which saved me some trouble.
